I’m Andrew - an undergraduate at <a href=\"https://www.vanderbilt.edu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Vanderbilt</a> studying computer science and applied mathematics. I’m especially interested in the intersection of computer science with linguistics, business, finance, and healthcare. </p>\n<p>🗽 I’ll be spending my 2022 Summer at Meta/Facebook in their New York Office! More to come on this soon.</p>\n<p>🧠 This past summer, I interned at <a href=\"https://brain.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Brain Technologies</a>, a startup aiming to make software more natural by connecting users with products and services via a real-time generative interface. Specifically, I worked on personalizing recommendations across their food and shopping domains using GPT-3 and improving their intent recognition system using a DL model to account for both multi-domain intents and vague queries. </p>\n<p>🏥 Previously, I’ve built an interest in healthcare through my work at <a href=\"https://www.vumc.org/main/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC)</a>, working on integrating pediatric height calculation functionality into the VUMC electronic health record. Last year, I assisted NLP research at the <a href=\"https://zjyin.github.io/spherelab/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Social Computing for Health and Well-being Research (#SPHERE) lab</a>, learning about fine-tuned BERT classification and topic modeling (LDA, structural) in analyzing online discussion posts by Alzheimer’s Disease caregivers. </p>\n<p>😃 Outside of class, here are a few things that I’ve been doing recently:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>reading about VC/entrepreneurship/tech using <a href=\"https://hq.getmatter.app\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Matter</a></li>\n<li>browsing New balance releases (love my grey 992s 👟)</li>\n<li>trying to draw (urban sketching ✒️) </li>\n<li>attempting to play electric guitar 🎸</li>\n<li>diving into beat-making/music production with Ableton 🎹</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Before the pandemic, I was a violinist in Vanderbilt’s Blair School of Music Orchestra, played golf, and solved Rubik’s cubes fast.</p>\n<p>📨 If you wanna chat or send me a message, please feel free to reach out to me at this email: andrew <em>dot</em> k <em>dot</em> nam <em>at</em> vanderbilt.edu</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"About","date":null,"description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/pages/about/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","3698005521","401334301"]}
