I’m Andrew - an undergraduate at <a href=\"https://www.vanderbilt.edu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Vanderbilt</a> studying computer science and applied mathematics. I’m especially interested in the intersection of computer science with linguistics, business, finance, and healthcare. </p>\n<p>🧠 Currently I am an intern at <a href=\"https://brain.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Brain Technologies</a>, a startup aiming to make software more natural by connecting users with products and services via a real-time generative interface. I’ve only been here a few weeks, but it has been super exciting being able to explore NLP with my teammates. </p>\n<p>🏥 I’ve built an interest in healthcare through my work at <a href=\"https://www.vumc.org/main/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC)</a>, working on integrating pediatric height calculation functionality into the VUMC electronic health record. More recently I’ve been assisting NLP research at the <a href=\"https://zjyin.github.io/spherelab/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Social Computing for Health and Well-being Research (#SPHERE) lab</a>, learning about fine-tuned BERT classification and structural topic modeling in analyzing online discussion posts by Alzheimer’s Disease caregivers. </p>\n<p>😃 Outside of work, I like to read about VC and entrepreneurship, teach Korean through Vanderbilt’s Language Mentorship program, and attempt to play electric guitar. I’m a huge language nerd, so I keep a personal dictionary of words (mostly Korean, some English, and some Mandarin) in an IPhone note. I do the same thing for cool stuff I find while browsing the internet.</p>\n<p>Before the pandemic, I was a violinist in Vanderbilt’s Blair School of Music Orchestra, played golf, and solved Rubik’s cubes fast.</p>\n<p>📨 If you wanna chat or send me a message, please feel free to reach out to me at this email: andrew.k.nam@vanderbilt.edu</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"About","date":null,"description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/pages/about/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","3698005521","401334301"]}
