😎 Hello! I’m Andrew - an undergraduate at [Vanderbilt](https://www.vanderbilt.edu) studying computer science and applied mathematics. I'm especially interested in the intersection of computer science with linguistics, business, finance, and healthcare. 

🗽 I'll be spending my 2022 Summer at Meta/Facebook in their New York Office! More to come on this soon.

🧠 This past summer, I interned at [Brain Technologies](https://brain.ai/), a startup aiming to make software more natural by connecting users with products and services via a real-time generative interface. Specifically, I worked on personalizing recommendations across their food and shopping domains using GPT-3 and improving their intent recognition system using a DL model to account for both multi-domain intents and vague queries. 

🏥 Previously, I've built an interest in healthcare through my work at [Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC)](https://www.vumc.org/main/home), working on integrating pediatric height calculation functionality into the VUMC electronic health record. Last year, I assisted NLP research at the [Social Computing for Health and Well-being Research (#SPHERE) lab](https://zjyin.github.io/spherelab/), learning about fine-tuned BERT classification and topic modeling (LDA, structural) in analyzing online discussion posts by Alzheimer's Disease caregivers. 

😃 Outside of class, here are a few things that I've been doing recently:
- reading about VC/entrepreneurship/tech using [Matter](https://hq.getmatter.app)
- trying to draw (urban sketching!)
- attempting to play electric guitar
- diving into beat-making/music production with Ableton
- browsing New balance releases (love my grey 992s 👟)

Before the pandemic, I was a violinist in Vanderbilt's Blair School of Music Orchestra, played golf, and solved Rubik's cubes fast.
