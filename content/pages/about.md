😎 Hello! I’m Andrew - an undergraduate at [Vanderbilt](https://www.vanderbilt.edu) studying computer science and applied mathematics. I'm especially interested in the intersection of machine learning with linguistics, business, finance, and healthcare. 

🧠 Currently I am an intern at [Brain Technologies](https://brain.ai/), a startup aiming to make software more natural by connecting users with products and services via a real-time generative interface. I've only been here a few weeks, but it has been super exciting being able to explore NLP with my teammates. 

🏥 I've built an interest in healthcare through my work at [Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC)](https://www.vumc.org/main/home), working on integrating pediatric height calculation functionality into the VUMC electronic health record. More recently I've been assisting NLP research at the [Social Computing for Health and Well-being Research (#SPHERE) lab](https://zjyin.github.io/spherelab/), learning about fine-tuned BERT classification and structural topic modeling in analyzing online discussion posts by Alzheimer's Disease caregivers. 

😃 Outside of work, I like to read about VC and entrepreneurship, learn about stocks, teach Korean through Vanderbilt's Language Mentorship program, and attempt to play electric guitar. I'm a huge language nerd, so I keep a personal dictionary of words (mostly Korean, some English, and some Mandarin) in an IPhone note. I do the same thing for cool stuff I find while browsing the internet.

Before the pandemic, I was a violinist in Vanderbilt's Blair School of Music Orchestra, played golf, and solved Rubik's cubes fast.
