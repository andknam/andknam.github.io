😎 Hello! I’m Andrew - an undergraduate at [Vanderbilt](https://www.vanderbilt.edu) studying computer science and applied mathematics. I'm especially interested in the intersection of machine learning with linguistics, business, finance, and healthcare. 

🧠 I'm currently interning at [Brain Technologies](https://brain.ai/), a startup aiming to make software more natural by connecting users with products and services via a real-time generative interface (think of it as an NLP-powered application allowing you to access Lyft, Amazon Prime, Doordash, grocery shopping, and movie booking all-in-one). So far I've dived into the design process for feature ideation and beta domain creation with a few teammates. 

🏥 I've built an interest in healthcare through my work at [Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC)](https://www.vumc.org/main/home), working on integrating pediatric height calculation functionality into the VUMC electronic health record. More recently I've been assisting NLP research at the [Social Computing for Health and Well-being Research (#SPHERE) lab](https://zjyin.github.io/spherelab/), learning about fine-tuned BERT classification and structural topic modeling in analyzing online discussion posts by Alzheimer's Disease caregivers. 

😃 Outside of work, I like to read about VC and entrepreneurship, teach Korean through Vanderbilt's Language Mentorship program, and attempt to play electric guitar. Before the pandemic, I was a violinist in Vanderbilt's Blair School of Music Orchestra, played golf, and solved Rubik's cubes fast.
